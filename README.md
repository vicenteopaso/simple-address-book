I created this project, from scratch, but with some of the React basics, like `react-scripts` â€” foregoing tools like `npx` and other scaffolding or skeleton building utilities. As such, you can run either of the commands at the bottom of this document.

As suggested on the Challenge docs, the following are some of the tools used:
- React
- Babel (through react-scripts)
- ESLint (through react-scripts)

**Please note that _this app will build and run on NPM LTS (6.x)_, and not on 3.x as specified on the Challenge Docs**. I took the risk and liberty to go with a higher NPM version, in hopes that you will value the code quality, design, and functionality built into the app; including libraries and components like Google Fonts, FontAwesome, Bootstrap4, and others, in order to improve the UI and UX of the app.

> ## Available Scripts

> You will also see any lint errors in the console.
> 
> ##### `npm run build`
> 
> Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
